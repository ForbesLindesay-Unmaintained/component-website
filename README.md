component-website
=================

This project has now become inactive. The shiny new website is up on [component.io](http://component.io).
Its GitHub repo is [component/component.io](https://github.com/component/component.io). If you have any great ideas or
issues please put them there. :)

Old Readme
----------

The component website, currently available to view at https://component.jit.su and hopefully will be at http://component.io once it's finished.

The website serves 2 key purposes:

 1. Educate people about what component is, and how to use it
 2. Help people find and consume useful components by providing information about licencing, testing etc. and pre-built versions of components.
